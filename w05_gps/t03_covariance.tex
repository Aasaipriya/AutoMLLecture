\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Covariance function of a GP}

The marginalization property of the Gaussian process implies that for any set of input values, the corresponding vector of function values is Gaussian:

  $$
    \bm{f} = \left[f\left(\xI{1}\right),\dot, f\left(\xI{n}\right)\right] \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\bm{m}, \bm{K}\right),
  $$ 


\begin{itemize}

  \item The covariance matrix $\bm{K}$ is constructed based on the chosen inputs $\left\{\xI{1},\dots,\xI{n}\right\}$.
  \item Entry $\bm{K}_{ij}$ is computed by $k\left(\xI{i}, \xI{j}\right)$.
  \item Technically, for \textbf{every} choice of inputs $\left\{\xI{1},\dot,\xI{n}\right\}$, $\bm{K}$ needs to be positive semi-definite in order to be a valid covariance matrix.
  \item A function $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ satisfying this property is called \textbf{positive definite}.
  
\end{itemize}
