\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{MS-Continuity and Differentiability}

We wish to describe a Gaussian process in terms of its smoothness. There are several notions of continuity for random variables. One is the continuity/differentiability in mean square (MS).

\begin{block}{Definition}
A Gaussian process $f(\x)$ is said to be \textbf{MS continuous} at $\x_*$, if
\vspace{-3mm}
$$\expectation[|f(\xI{k}) - f(\x_*)|^2] \overset{k \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \text{ for all converging sequences } \xI{k} \overset{k \to \infty}{\longrightarrow} \x_*.$$

\vspace{5mm}
A Gaussian process $f(\x)$ is said to be \textbf{MS differentiable} along the $i$ direction, if the following limit exists, with $\bm{e}_i = (0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0)^\top$ being the unit vector along the $i$-th axis. $$\lim_{h\to 0}\expectation[|\frac{f(\x + h\,\bm{e}_i) - f(\x)}{h}|]$$ 
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\item The MS continuity/differentiability do not necessarily lead to the continuity/differentiability of sampled functions!
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The MS continuity/differentiability of a Gaussian process can be derived from the smoothness properties of the kernel.
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The GP is continuous in MS iff the covariance function $k(\x, \x^\prime)$ is continuous.
\vspace{.5cm}

\item The MS derivative of a Gaussian process exists iff the second derivative $\frac{\partial^{2} k(\x, \x^\prime)}{\partial \x\partial \x^\prime}$ exists.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Squared Exponential Covariance Function}

The squared exponential function is one of the most commonly used covariance functions.
$$
k(\x, \x^\prime) = \exp\biggl(- \frac{\|\x - \x^\prime\|^2}{2\ls^2}\biggr).
$$

\textbf{Properties}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\faLightbulbO] It depends merely on the distance $r = \|\x - \x^\prime\|$ $\to$ isotropic and stationary.\lz
\item[\faLightbulbO] Infinitely differentiable $\to$ the corresponding GP is too smooth.\lz
\item[\faLightbulbO] It utilizes strong smoothness assumptions $\to$ unrealistic for modeling most of the physical processes.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Upcrossing Rate and Characteristic Length-Scale}

\begin{itemize}
\item Another way to describe a Gaussian process is the expected number of up-crossings at level-0 on the unit interval, which we denote by $N_0$.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{figure/upcrossings-1.pdf}
\end{figure}

\item For an isotropic covariance function $k(r)$, the expected number of up-crossings can be calculated explicitly:
$$
\expectation[N_0] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{- k^{\prime\prime}(0)}{k(0)}}.
$$

\end{itemize}


\framebreak
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Example (squared exponential):
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
k(r) &=& \exp\biggl(-\frac{r^2}{2\ls^2}\biggr)\\
k^\prime(r) &=& - k(r) \cdot \frac{r}{\ls^2} \\
k^{\prime\prime}(r) &=&  k(r) \cdot \frac{r^2}{\ls^4} - k(r) \cdot \frac{1}{\ls^2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{5mm}
The expected number of upcrossings at level-0 is

$$
\E[N_0] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{- k^{\prime\prime}(0)}{k(0)}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{\ls^2}} = (2\pi \ls)^{-1}.
$$
