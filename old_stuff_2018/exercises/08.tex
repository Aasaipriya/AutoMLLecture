	To get access to our cluster you should have sent us already your tf-pool username. As everyone of you will have to prepare a final project in which you can use the compute resources,
	it is important that both team-members send us their username.\\\noindent
	We maintain a WIKI in which you can read all about the commands you will need to work on the META cluster. \url{https://aadwiki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Meta_Slurm}\\\\\noindent
	After you now know how to use algorithm configuration,
	your next task is to configure the SAT solver \textit{SATenstein} to optimize its performance using SMAC.
	
	\bigskip
	
	The scenario consists of the following directories
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{SATenstein}: a directory with the binary of \textit{SATenstein} and a basic framework for an algorithm wrapper that uses \texttt{genericWrapper4AC}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mlindauer/GenericWrapper4AC}} (to install it execute \texttt{make init} in folder exercise\_sheet\_07)
		\item \texttt{indu}: a directory with industrial instances from various SAT competitions. All instances are satisfiable!
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{questions}
		
		\titledquestion{Configuration of \textit{SATenstein}}[18]
		
		Given the above mentioned files, your task is to optimize the performance of \textit{SATenstein} on the provided instances with \textit{SMACv3}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/automl/SMAC3}}. You will have to clone the smac repository to use its command line interface\footnote{\url{https://automl.github.io/SMAC3/stable/quickstart.html\#command-line}}. You can however choose to use smac as a python package instead\footnote{\url{https://github.com/automl/ParameterImportance/blob/master/notebooks/interface_example.ipynb} (see lines 2-6)}.
		To use either method of running SMAC, please work through the following steps:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Split the instances in a training (\texttt{training.txt}) and test set (\texttt{test.txt}) -- write a bash or Python script to do it and upload it into your \texttt{src} folder. The set should be split evenly into training and test. The given set of instances is \textbf{heterogeneous} and consists of instances from two domains. You have to be mindful how you split the instances. The instance names indicate if they are from the same domain.
			\item Complete the Python script \texttt{wrapper.py}; the call to \textit{SATenstein} should look like:\\
			\texttt{\small satenstein/ubcsat -param1 value1 $\ldots$ -paramN valueN -seed <int> -inst <instance> -target 0 -r satcomp -cutoff <max search steps> -timeout <max running time>}\\
			e.g. \texttt{\small satenstein/ubcsat -alg satenstein -adaptive 0 -inst indu/factor-3023-3607.cnf -target 0 -seed 0 -r satcomp -cutoff -1 -timeout 5}\\
			\\
			You can fix cutoff to -1 as you will optimize runtime.\\
			You can verify the functionality of the completed wrapper with the following call:\\
			\texttt{\small python satenstein/wrapper.py indu/factor-3023-3607.cnf 0 5 0 1 -adaptive 1}\\
			This calls the wrapper to run SATenstein on instance \texttt{indu/factor-3023-3607.cnf}, with 0 as \texttt{instance specifics}, a  \texttt{cutoff} of 5 seconds and a  \texttt{runlength} of 0 (which should be ignored by your wrapper and instead set to -1),  \texttt{seed} 1 and the parameter \texttt{adaptive} set to 1.\\
			\\ The final printed line will look something like this:\\
			\texttt{\small Result for ParamILS: <Status>, <runningtime>, <runlenght>, <quality>, <seed>}
			\\
			All the paramters for the call to the wrapper will be automatically set by SMAC during optimization, so your wrapper only needs to construct the cmdline call to SATenstein.
			
			\item Complete the scenario file (\texttt{scenario.txt}) that defines the following characteristics of the configuration scenario
			\begin{itemize}
				\item use your generated training and test files (\texttt{train.txt} and \texttt{test.txt})
				\item the algorithm is non-deterministic
				\item optimize runtime
				\item the overall objective is the mean10 (PAR10) score
				\item the cutoff time time will be $5$ seconds
				\item the configuration budget will be $900$ seconds
			\end{itemize}
			\item Run \textit{SMAC} with the above defined scenario \textit{on the provided compute resources} and report the performance of the configured \textit{SATenstein} on the test instances.
			\item Validate the default configuration (\textit{also on the provided compute resources}) of \textit{SATenstein} on the test instances -- you can use SMACs validation script and the script provided in \texttt{src/read\_validation\_data.py}. This will print some details about all validated configurations.
			Report the performance of the default configuration as well as the incumbent.
			\item Upload all files you created, i.e. training and test files, SMAC output as well as the validated runhistory.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\titledquestion{Feedback}[Bonus: 1]
		For each question in this assignment, state:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How long you worked on it.
			\item What you learned.
			\item Anything you would improve in this question if you were teaching the course.
		\end{itemize}
