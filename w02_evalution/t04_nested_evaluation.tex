    \begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}
    Selecting the best model from a set of potential candidates (e.g.\ different
    classes of learners, different hyperparameter settings, different feature
    sets, different preprocessing\ldots) is an important part of most  machine
    learning problems. However,

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We cannot evaluate our finally selected learner on the same
            resampling splits that we have used to perform model selection for
            it, e.g.\ to tune its hyperparameters.
        \item By repeatedly evaluating the learner on the same test set, or the same CV splits, information
          about the test set \enquote{leaks} into our evaluation.
        \item Danger of overfitting to the resampling splits / overtuning!
        \item The final performance estimate will be optimistically biased.
        \item One could also see this as a problem similar to multiple testing.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Motivating Example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume a binary classification problem with equal class sizes.
        \item Assume a learner with hyperparameter $\lambda$.
        \item Here, the learner is a (nonsense) feature-independent classifier,
              where $\lambda$ has no effect. The learner simply
              predicts random labels with equal probability.
        \item Of course, it's true generalization error is 50\%.
        \item A cross-validation of the learner (with any fixed $\lambda$) will easily show this
          (given that the partitioned data set for CV is not too small).
        \item Now lets \enquote{tune} it, by trying out 100 different $\lambda$ values.
        \item We repeat this experiment 50 times and average results.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Plotted is the best \enquote{tuning error} (i.e.\ the performance of the model with fixed $\lambda$ as evaluated by the cross-validation) after $k$ tuning iterations.
    \item We have performed the experiment for different sizes of learning data
          that where cross-validated.
    \end{itemize}

        \includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{dist-tuning1}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item For 1 experiment, the CV score will be nearly 0.5, as expected
    \item We basically sample from a (rescaled) binomial distribution when we calculate error rates
    \item And multiple experiment scores are also nicely arranged around the expected mean 0.5
    \end{itemize}

    \framebreak

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[height=.6\textheight]{dist-tuning2}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item But in tuning we take the minimum of those! So we don't really estimate the "average performance" anymore, we get an estimate of "best case" performance instead.
    \item The more we sample, the more "biased" this value becomes. 
    \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}[c,allowframebreaks]{Untouched Test Set Principle}
    Countermeasure: simulate what actually happens in model application.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item All parts of the model building (including model selection,
      preprocessing) should be embedded in the model-finding process
      \textbf{on the training data}.
    \item The test set should only be touched once, so we have no way of \enquote{cheating}. The test dataset is only used once \emph{after} a model is completely trained, after deciding for example on specific hyper-parameters. 

    Only if we do this are the performance estimates we obtained from the test set  \textbf{unbiased estimates} of the true performance.

    \framebreak

    \item For steps that themselves require resampling (e.g.\ hyperparameter tuning) this results
      in \textbf{nested resampling}, i.e.\ resampling strategies for both
      \begin{itemize} 
      \item tuning: an inner resampling loop to find what works best based on training data 
      \item outer evaluation on data not used for tuning to get honest estimates of the expected performance on new data
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
